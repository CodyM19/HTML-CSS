        <h1> Have you ever made a pizza from scratch ?</h1>
		<h2> Yeah, but have you really thought about it ?</h2>
		<h3> Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base it doesn't work?</h3>
		<h4> Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce it's messed up too.</h4>

        <p class=special> Making a pizza is all about the order of operations.
            You need to get the dough right first, then add the sauce, followed by the cheese and toppings.
            It's a delicate balance that requires attention to detail and a bit of culinary skill.</p>
        <p> Pizzas are sort of like lines of code.
            The process of making a pizza is almost always created in the same order of intsructions.</p>

        <h5 class=special> This is the common order of operations.</h5>
        <p> We will list them here.</p>
<!-- This is an ordered list-->
